# Stocktracker_Springboot
Stocktracker is a demo application with Springboot, HTML and CSS tools about inventory control.
This application was made as a final degree work with my colleagues with the intention of providing large inventory companies with an intuitive and easy to use app.

The application has several functions:

* User control (Login)
* Add, modify and delete products
* Product and customer search
* Sending products to customer
